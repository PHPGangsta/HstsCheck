This script checks the Alexa Top 1 Million websites if they support HTTPS and if they have the "Strict-Transport-Security"-Header.
The results are written to a database, see table.sql for the schema.

The crawler has been written by using pthreads, to be able to parallelize it, otherwise it would take days to crawl 1 million URLS.

You can download the results as CSV file from here: http://hstscheck.phpgangsta.de/results_2013-11-24.csv.zip
You can see some statistics at http://hstscheck.phpgangsta.de or (german): http://www.phpgangsta.de/hsts-http-strict-transport-security-hasts-schon
